# Contributing to Raha Foundation
Hello and thank you for your interest in contributing to Raha.io!  Community
contributions in the form of code, money, expertise, publicity, and feedback
are crucial to the success of Raha in creating an equitable and trusted digital
currency.

The following document contains information on how to become a contributor to
Raha and participate in our community.

## How to become a contributor
All contributors must first sign a Raha Foundation Contributor License
Agreement. This is for the protection of the Foundation and you.

If you are an individual contributor, please submit the [Individual Contributor
License Agreement](https://goo.gl/forms/RyS5HzSI3tKy9ZFp2). 

If you are contributing as part of your job, please have your organization
sumbit the [Entity Contributor License
Agreement](https://goo.gl/forms/ccnRhyqOn7OXtxy42).

The following resources have more information on Contributor License Agreements
including why they are necessary and how to interpret them:

Initial inspiration for this contributor document came from Stellar's
[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-core/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Submitting code to Raha
All code changes to Raha must be submitted as pull requests on the relevant
Raha Github repository. After being reviewed and approved by a Raha Foundation
developer, the pull request will be merged into the master branch as a rebase
commit. It is recommended that you develop patches to fix existing issues or
create an issue before submitting a pull request. Creating an issue allows the
community to have a conversation around the best way to solve a problem before
you go through the work of creating a patch for it. Relatively minor code and
documentation fixes probably don't need an issue, however. For now - use your
discretion. :)

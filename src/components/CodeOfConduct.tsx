    <h2 id="purpose">1. Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      A primary goal of Raha is to be inclusive to the largest number of
      contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As
      such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming
      environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability,
      ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).
    </p>
    <p>
      This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
      participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable
      behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      We invite all those who participate in Raha to help us create safe and
      positive experiences for everyone.
    </p>
    <h2 id="open-sourceculturetech-citizenship">2. Raha Citizenship</h2>
    <p>
      A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open Raha
      citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the
      relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action
      is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of
      power that exist in society.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community
      is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to
      the fullest extent, we want to know.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members
      engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing
      unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events,

      distress.
